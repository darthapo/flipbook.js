    - Progress

    - Maybe an info/help button?

### Notes
- On first load it should show the help overlays.

### Tooling
- Apps for prepping the images... Maybe PS actions.
- MangaStudio Actions for adding pages, and toggling visibility to flip
  the panels. (For PS too?)
- Layer Groups at the root, one for each 'page.' Page 1 on the bottom, the
  final page on top.
- Action to auto name the groups, sequentially?

### Tech Notes
- External modules
    - 'ensure/jquery' -- and/or other requirements that are needed
    - They can automatically add a cdn script to the page, and run
      a callback on load?
